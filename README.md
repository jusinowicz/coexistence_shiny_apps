# coexistence_shiny_apps
This folder contains R shiny apps for two-species competition models with variable recruitment (lognormal). 
These are designed as teaching tools to explore the impacts of different parameter values. The default visualization is a 
2D map of the population (NOTE: This is not actually a spatially explicit model). Graphs of the total population of each species can be turned on. 
A .csv file of populations can be downloaded.

The code can be downloaded and run locally with the shiny R library. It is also run on a server at:

Leslie-Gower model:

Lottery model:
