This is an R shiny app which implements the two-species lottery competition model with variable recruitment (lognormal). 
It is designed as a teaching tool to explore the impacts of different parameter values. The default visualization is a 2D map of the population (NOTE: This is not actually a spatially explicit model). 
Graphs of the total population of each species can be turned on. 
A .csv file of populations can be downloaded.

The code can be downloaded and run locally with the shiny R library. It is also run on a server at:
